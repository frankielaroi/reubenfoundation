                            We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who help us deliver our programs, operate our website, or carry out administrative functions. These providers include payment processors, application reviewers, hosting services, email communication platforms, and data management tools. All service providers are required to handle your data securely and are only permitted to use it for the specific tasks assigned to them by us.

                        <h3>a. Security Measures</h3>
                        <p>
                            We use industry-standard security protocols to safeguard data both in transit and at rest. This includes the use of:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect data during transmission</li>
                            <li>Firewalls and regular system monitoring</li>
                            <li>Password-protected databases with restricted access</li>
                            <li>Secure servers maintained by trusted hosting providers</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Access to your personal data is limited to authorized staff, volunteers, or third-party service providers who need it to perform specific tasks related to our programs, services, or operations. These individuals and entities are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information.
                        </p>

                        <h3>b. Data Retention</h3>
                        <p>
                            We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. This includes fulfilling legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When your information is no longer needed, we securely delete or anonymize it.
                        </p>

                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scholarship and grant applicants' information may be stored until the end of the program cycle or in line with donor reporting obligations</li>
                            <li>Donor and financial records may be kept for a period required by tax or legal regulations</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>c. Limitations</h3>
                        <p>
                            While we do our best to protect your information, no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is completely secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security, but we will act swiftly and responsibly in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We encourage you to help keep your own data secure by avoiding the use of public networks when submitting personal information and by notifying us immediately if you suspect unauthorized activity related to your data.

                            Our website and programs are not primarily directed at children under the age of 18. However, some of our initiatives, such as educational scholarships, youth development programs, or creative arts competitions, may involve minors as participants. In such cases, we may collect limited personal information (such as name, age, contact information, and academic history) for the sole purpose of administering the program.
